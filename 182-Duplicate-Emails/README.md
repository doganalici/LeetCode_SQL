# 182. Duplicate Emails

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement

Table: `Person`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```
`id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not `NULL`.

Return the result table in any order.

## Example 1

**Input:** 

Person table:
```text
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```

**Output:** 
```text
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```

**Explanation:** `a@b.com` is repeated two times.
